How long did you spend on this?

I dedicated around 18 hours over 3 productive days to the project. This time was spent on planning, implementation, testing, and refining the overall user experience.

Did you complete your implementation?

I successfully completed the core features outlined in the requirements. The only feature that remains unimplemented is the movie detail view, which could be added with more time.

What would you have added if you had more time?

With more time, I would enhance the user experience by incorporating smoother animations and transitions to improve the app’s flow. Additionally, I would prioritize writing integration tests to ensure the app’s robustness and stability across different scenarios.

What was the most difficult part of the app?

The most challenging aspect was implementing pagination, as I was new to handling scroll events for data loading. It required careful attention to efficiently manage state while dynamically fetching and displaying content. I learned a great deal during the process.

What was your favorite part of the app?

I particularly enjoyed implementing the modular architecture. Structuring the app into different packages, applying a design system, and incorporating design patterns allowed me to build a scalable and maintainable codebase.

Is there anything else you’d like to add?

If given the opportunity, I would love to add a media playback feature that allows users to watch trailers or other media content directly within the app.
